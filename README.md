# recommendation_program

## Introduction
This is the program I have created for the Codecademy recommendation program project.

## The Program
This is a simple recommendation program. I decided to make it about retro games.

You will be asked to enter letters to choose a company. If any companies start with that
letter, you will be asked if you want to see some great games to play on that company's console/consoles.

I hope this introduces you to some new games to play.
